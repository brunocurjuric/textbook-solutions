    "On 2003 August 27, Mars was in opposition as seen from the Earth. On 2005 July 14 (687 days later), Mars was in western quadrature as seen from the Earth. What was the distance of Mars from the Sun on these dates, measured in astronomical units (AU)? Is this greater than or less than the semimajor axis length of the Martian orbit? You may assume the Earth’s orbit is a perfect circle. (Hint: the sidereal period of Mars is also 687 days.)"

    "In the 1670s, the astronomer Ole Rømer observed eclipses of the Galilean satellite Io as it plunged through Jupiter’s shadow once per orbit. He noticed that the time between observed eclipses became shorter as Jupiter came closer to the Earth and longer as Jupiter moved away. Rømer calculated that the eclipses were observed 17 minutes earlier when Jupiter was in opposition compared to when it was close to conjunction. This was attributed by Rømer to the finite speed of light. From Rømer’s data, compute the speed of light, first in AU min$^{-1}$, then in m s$^{-1}$."

Does the Coriolis effect deflect the ball to the right or to the left? By what amount (in meters) is the ball deflected? Does the receiver need to worry about correcting for the deflection, or should he be more worried about being nailed by the free safety? (Hint: the angular velocity **$\\vec{\\omega}$** of the Earth’s rotation is parallel to the rotation axis.)"
